    "description": "DPM Tools is a collection of modules for processing and visualization of porous media images. Integrated as workflows, the combination of all module functions provide end-to-end capabilities that streamline pre- and post- processing of porous media images. Individual and combined functions can be used to curate images for publication, prepare images for simulation and machine learning (ML) applications, and analyze simulation and ML results. \n\nBy design, DPM Tools integrate functions from open Python packages to implement common digital porous media as workflows.\n\nDPM Tools is implemented within the Digital Porous Media Portal (formerly Digital Rocks Portal) and as a standalone image processing workflow that users can download.\n\nCurrent Modules:\n---\n\n- Input/Output (IO): Tools for reading and writing digital porous media images from raw, tiff, hdf5, netCDF and matlab files. The tools can edit and convert the files. \n\n- Metrics: includes several functions for quantifying geometric properties of images.\n\n- Segmentation: algorithms for classifying phases within an image.\n\n- Visualization: workflows for 3D visualization with PyVista.\n\nFurther documentation and descriptions of how to use the different modules are available in the related links of this document and in the landing page where the software is published in Zenodo. Our team is continuously maintaining the software and adding new modules. \n\nThis release of DPM Tools is packaged with all necessary dependencies. There is no need to install these packages manually.\n",
