=====================================

Welcome to Digital Porous Media (DPM) Tools! Our team at The University of Texas at Austin has put together a collection of Python tools and workflows to help streamline analysis of digital porous media images. 

Our intent is for these tools to be used with `Digital Porous Media Portal <https://https://digitalporousmedia.org/>`_ (formerly Digital Rocks Portal), an excellent source of data! The Portal has undergone significant redesign, and we are excited to unveil it with these integrated tools!

- ``io``: Tools for obtaining, reading, and writing digital porous media images in a variety of file formats.
- ``metrics``: Functions for quantifying geometric properties of images
- ``segmentation``: Algorithms for classifying phases within an image
- ``visualization``: Workflows for 3D visualization
